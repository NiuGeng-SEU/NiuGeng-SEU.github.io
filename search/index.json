They not only help us understand our physical condition in depth but also reveal potential health issues, guiding us to adjust our lifestyle for better health. Early detection and treatment before problems worsen are key benefits of these check-ups.\nThis approach allows us to effectively address health challenges brought on by modern lifestyles, maintaining a good state of physical and mental health.\nChoosing Medical Examination Packages Firstly, we need to decide on the type of medical examination package to choose. The price range for different packages varies widely, from a few hundred yuan for basic entry-level check-ups to more than ten thousand yuan for comprehensive, high-end packages. Beyond cost considerations, we should also choose based on personal factors such as age, gender, medical history, and family health history.\nInitially, I booked the Nanjing Zhongda Hospital Physical Examination Package No. 2 (Male). However, I later found out that pre-booking wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary as the hospital had ample appointment slots available for on-site booking. During the on-site booking process, the doctor asked about my information and medical history to tailor the examination package to my needs. Based on the doctor\u0026rsquo;s recommendation and my health condition, I chose the Nanjing Zhongda Hospital Physical Examination Package No. 1 (Male), adding low-dose chest CT scan, neuron-specific enolase, and cytokeratin to the package. Examination Process Preparation for the examination should start three days in advance:\nMaintain a normal diet for three days before the examination, avoiding alcohol and high-fat, high-protein foods. Do not eat after 8 PM the day before the examination to ensure fasting for 10-12 hours before blood tests. Avoid eating and drinking on the morning of the examination. Nanjing Zhongda Hospital Upon arrival at the Nanjing Zhongda Hospital Physical Examination Center, the first step is to discuss with the doctor to finalize the examination items and complete the payment process.\nThen, fasting blood tests are conducted, followed by urine collection. Drinking plenty of water before ultrasound examinations is necessary to ensure a full bladder. Unfortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t hydrate sufficiently, leading to an inadequately filled bladder during the ultrasound.\nAfter each examination, the doctors note the next department to visit on the examination sheet, making it easy to follow the process. The entire testing procedure took about two hours.\nAfter completing the examination, a complimentary breakfast is provided.\nExamination Report Although the hospital mentioned it might take a few days for the report, my examination report was ready in just one day. I could query and download it via the WeChat public account.\nLow-Dose Chest CT Scan The results of the low-dose chest CT scan have a separate report and chest modeling, which can be viewed on the relevant page.\nThe chest walls on both sides are symmetric, the mediastinum and trachea are centered, and no abnormal density shadows are observed in the lungs. The lobes, segmental bronchi on both sides, lung hilum, and mediastinal structures appear normal. Slight thickening of both pleura, no abnormalities in the thoracic bones.\nNo significant abnormalities were found in the low-dose chest CT scan.\nIssues Identified Overweight Body Mass Index: 24.34 Overweight\nSuggested balanced diet, moderate exercise, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining psychological balance, regular lifestyle, and periodic monitoring of BMI and body fat percentage. Seek medical advice if necessary.\nRisk of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia Item Name Test Result Reference Range Unit Note Cholesterol 5.43 0.00\u0026ndash;6.20 mmol/L LDL Cholesterol 3.32 0.00\u0026ndash;3.40 mmol/L Systolic Pressure 136mmHg 120 mmHg Slightly Elevated Diastolic Pressure 79mmHg 80 mmHg Monitoring and Lifestyle Adjustment: Regular monitoring of blood pressure is advised, especially if there is a family history of hypertension or other risk factors. Lifestyle modifications, such as regular moderate-intensity exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing salt intake, increasing fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, and stress reduction, can help control blood pressure.\nMedical Consultation: If concerned about blood pressure levels or risk factors, consult a doctor. They may provide further tests and personalized professional advice.\nDiet Adjustment: Considering the levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), consider a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol. Focus on foods rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and omega-3 fatty acids.\nRegular Check-ups: Continue regular monitoring of blood lipid levels and blood pressure to detect any adverse changes and take appropriate measures.\nElevated Uric Acid Item Name Test Result Reference Range Unit Note Uric Acid 497 202.3\u0026ndash;416.5 μmol/L ↑ Mild increases in uric acid are often due to a high-purine diet, such as animal organs, meat, seafood, and fish. Significant increases can lead to gout, gouty arthritis, and gouty nephropathy. Occasional mild elevation in uric acid may not be clinically significant and can be rechecked. Persistent or significant elevation should be taken seriously, with an endocrinology consultation recommended.\nPlatelet Distribution Width Item Name Test Result Reference Range Unit Note Platelet Distribution Width 11.1 12\u0026ndash;16.5 FL ↓ Platelet Distribution Width (PDW) is an indicator of platelet size variation, reflecting the uniformity in size of platelets. A lower PDW usually suggests that the platelets are more uniform in size.\nA slightly low PDW is generally not considered a serious issue, especially if other platelet-related indices such as platelet count (PLT) are within normal ranges.\nPDW levels may fluctuate due to various factors, including physiological factors and technical variations in laboratory tests.\nNormal Sinus Rhythm Item Name Test Result Reference Range Unit Note ECG P wave: (-) QRS complex: (-) ST segment: (-) T wave: (-) Normal Sinus Rhythm Normal sinus rhythm is generally considered a manifestation of a normal heart rate. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), it indicates that the heartbeat originates from the heart\u0026rsquo;s natural pacemaker, the sinus node, at a regular rhythm and rate. This is a sign of normal heart function in adults and healthy children.\nPost-Examination Lifestyle Plan Weight Loss Goal:\nAim to reduce the Body Mass Index (BMI) to around 22 and maintain a body fat percentage of about 15%. Lifestyle Adjustments:\nBalanced Diet: Increase intake of vegetables and whole grains, decrease high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar foods. Increased Exercise: At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, plus two days of muscle-strengthening activities. Limit Alcohol: Reduce alcohol intake and avoid drinking if possible. Psychological Balance: Use meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques to reduce stress. Health Monitoring:\nRegular monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol, and uric acid levels. Dietary Adjustments:\nReduce the intake of high-purine foods, such as animal organs, certain seafood, and red meat. Increase the consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as deep-sea fish, and fiber-rich foods, like fruits and vegetables. By implementing these comprehensive measures, the plan aims to gradually improve overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\nMedical Examination - Chinese version 由于不健康的作息习惯和高油、高盐、高糖饮食等多种因素，一些通常出现在老年人身上的疾病和慢性病，现在越来越多地出现在青年群体身上。\n在这种情况下，定期体检成为了一个至关重要的工具。它不仅能帮助我们深入了解自己的身体状况，还能揭示潜在的健康问题，从而引导我们调整生活方式，以促进健康。它能使我们在问题尚未恶化之前进行早期发现、早期治疗。\n通过这种方式，我们能更有效地应对现代生活方式带来的健康挑战，保持良好的身心状态。\n体检项目选择 首先，我们需要确定选择哪类体检项目。不同体检项目的价格范围很广，有几百元的入职体检，还有上万元，包含众多项目的高端体检。在成本限制之外，我们还需根据个人的年龄、性别、既往病史和家族病史等来选择合适的体检项目。\n最初，我预约了南京中大医院体检套餐2号（男）这个项目。但其实并没有提前预约的必要性，南京中大医院号源充足，现场预约也可。现场预约的过程中，医生会询问你的信息、病史等来定制化你的体检项目。根据医生的推荐，基于我的个人健康状况，我选择了南京中大医院体检套餐1号（男）这个项目，并加项了胸部低剂量CT平扫，神经元特异性烯醇化酶和细胞角蛋白项目。 体检流程 体检需要提前三天进行准备：\n体检的前三天保持正常饮食，勿饮酒及食用高脂肪、高蛋白类食物。 体检前一天晚餐8点后不再进食，保证空腹10-12小时抽血检验。 体检的当日早晨禁食、水。 南京中大医院 到达南京中大医院体检中心后，首先需要与医生交流，确定将要进行的项目内容，并完成支付流程。\n之后先进行空腹抽血，并领取尿管进行尿液采集。在进行彩超检查前，需要大量饮水以保持膀胱的充盈状态。不幸的是，我未能及时补充足够的水分，导致在彩超检查过程中膀胱未能充分膨胀。\n体检过程中，每项检查后的医生都会在体检单上注明下一项检查的科室位置。因此，只需按照体检单上的指示依次进行各项检查即可。整个测试过程大约用时两小时。\n完成体检之后，还有赠送的早餐领取。\n体检报告 尽管医院说需要几天才能出报告，不过我的体检报告一天后就完成了，可以在微信公众号上进行查询和下载。\n胸部低剂量CT平扫 其中的胸部低剂量CT平扫结果会有单独报告和胸部建模，可以在相关页面上进行查看。\n两侧胸廓形态对称，纵隔及气管居中，肺内未见异常密度影。双侧肺叶、段支气管形态未见异常，两侧肺门及纵隔结构未见异常。双侧胸膜稍增厚，胸廓诸骨未见异常。\n胸部低剂量CT平扫未见明显异常。\n问题 超重 体重指数：24.34 超重\n建议平衡膳食，适量运动，戒烟限酒，心理平衡，生活规律，定期监测体重指数及体脂率。必要 时在医生指导下进行治疗。\n高血压风险、高血脂风险 项目名称 检查结果 参考范围 单位 提示 胆固醇 5.43 0.00\u0026ndash;6.20 mmol/L 低密度脂蛋白 3.32 0.00\u0026ndash;3.40 mmol/L 收缩压 136mmHg 120 mmHg 正常高值 舒张压 79mmHg 80 mmHg 监测与生活方式调整：建议定期监测血压，特别是如果您有高血压的家族史或其他风险因素。生活方式的调整，如定期进行中等强度的运动、维持健康体重、减少盐的摄入量、增加水果和蔬菜的摄入量、限制酒精摄入量以及减少压力，都有助于控制血压。\n医疗咨询：如果您对血压水平或风险因素感到担忧，建议咨询医生。医生可能会提供进一步的检查和专业的个性化建议。\n饮食调整：鉴于您的胆固醇和低密度脂蛋白（LDL）的水平，考虑采取低饱和脂肪和低胆固醇的饮食。加强对富含全谷物、蔬菜、水果和富含omega-3脂肪酸的食物的摄入。\n定期检查：继续定期检查血脂水平和血压，以便及时发现任何不良变化，并采取相应措施。\n血尿酸增高 项目名称 检查结果 参考范围 单位 提示 血尿酸 497 202.3\u0026ndash;416.5 μmol/L ↑ 轻度尿酸增高多因高嘌呤饮食所致，如动物内脏、肉类、海鲜、鱼类等;明显增高则可导致痛风 、痛风性关节炎、痛风性肾病等。偶尔一次检查发现尿酸轻度增高，不一定有临床意义，可以复 查，如持续或明显增高，应引起重视，内分泌科就诊。\n血小板分布宽度 项目名称 检查结果 参考范围 单位 提示 血小板分布宽度 11.1 12\u0026ndash;16.5 FL ↓ 血小板分布宽度（PDW） 是血小板大小变异的一个指标，它反映了血小板的大小不一致性。PDW较低通常意味着血小板的大小比较一致。\nPDW指标略低通常不被视为一个严重问题，特别是如果其它血小板相关指标如血小板计数（PLT）等都在正常范围内。\nPDW指标可能因多种因素波动，包括生理因素和实验室测试的技术差异。\n窦性心律 项目名称 检查结果 参考范围 单位 提示 心电图 P波: (-) QRS波群: (-) ST段: (-) T波: (-) 窦性心律 窦性心律通常被视为正常心率的一种表现。在心电图（ECG）上，窦性心律意味着心跳是由心脏的自然起搏点，即窦房结（sinus node），以正常的节奏和速度发起的。这是成年人和健康儿童心脏正常功能的标志。\n后续生活计划 减重目标：\n将体重指数（BMI）降至22左右，并控制体脂率在15%左右。 生活方式调整：\n平衡饮食：增加蔬菜和全谷物的摄入，减少高热量、高脂肪和高糖的食物。 增加运动：每周至少进行150分钟的中等强度有氧运动，加上每周两天的肌肉强化训练。 限制酒精：减少酒精摄入，尽可能避免饮酒。 心理平衡：通过冥想、瑜伽或其他放松技巧来减轻压力。 健康监测：\n定期监测血压、胆固醇和血尿酸水平。 饮食调整：\n减少高嘌呤食物的摄入，如动物内脏、某些海鲜和红肉。 增加富含omega-3脂肪酸的食物，如深海鱼类，以及富含纤维的食物，如水果和蔬菜。 通过这些综合措施，计划逐步改善身体健康，并降低患慢性病的风险。\n","date":"2023-12-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://niugens.com/img/2312/Physical_examination_CT_image.webp","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/blog-2023-annual-medical-examination/","title":"[Blog] 2023 Annual Medical Examination"},{"content":"(Thumbnail reference from: A. du Plessis, http://blogs.sun.ac.za/ctscanner/concrete-cracking/, (2014).)\nIndustrial CT is the abbreviation of computerized tomography technology used in the industrial field. It can clearly, accurately and intuitively display the interior of the detected object in the form of two-dimensional tomographic images or three-dimensional images without damaging the detected object. The structure, composition, material and defect status are known as the best non-destructive testing and non-destructive evaluation technology today. It is a non-destructive testing technology with more accurate defect detection effect and more comprehensive detection content than flaw detection.\nEquipment model: Germany YXLON - Y.CT precision\nUser Guide 1. Start-up operation process: Turn on the main power Turn the control voltage key: 0 -\u0026gt; start -\u0026gt; 1. Turn the X-ray key: off -\u0026gt; on, wait for 5 minutes, on -\u0026gt; system ready -\u0026gt; active. Turn on the workstation computer, wait for the green light to turn on, turn on the CT workstation host, and enter the password. Open the hatch and make sure all shading sheets are placed at the X-ray source. Open the YXLON-CT software, create a new folder to enter the program, wait for the vacuum in the X-ray tube to reach 100%, and start to preheat the X-ray filament. Move the radiation detector as far as it will go. Prevent X-rays from causing excessive loss to the ray detection source during the preheating process. Run Start up to preheat the X-ray filament. If the preheating process is too slow, it is mainly due to insufficient internal vacuum, open the YXLON-Control software, and run the warm up and KV center processes respectively. Wait for the Start up to complete, and the startup process is completed, and the sample can be placed, the parameters adjusted, and the test steps performed. ⚠️: During non-long holidays, the main CT power supply is not turned off, and the workstation host and X-ray will be in standby mode. Normal working days can proceed directly from step 5.\n2. Sample preparation process: The sample is limited by its smallest confining cylinder size. Generally, the maximum diameter is 10cm. The minimum internal circular section of the sample should be parallel to the X-ray direction. The largest internal circular section should be perpendicular to the X-ray direction. It is best that the sample can be placed stably, if not, you need to use plasticine to fix it on the stage [1].\n[1] Plasticine will inevitably affect the imaging of the bottom of the sample, so the observation area should be far away from the bottom. 3. Placement process: Make sure the X-ray source is off. Choose suitable shading sheets. There are six shading sheets, according to the shading strength from weak to strong: 0.5mm aluminum sheet, 1mm aluminum sheet, 0.5mm iron sheet, 1mm iron sheet, 0.5mm lead sheet, 1mm lead sheet. When placed, the shading sheet with weak shading strength should be placed close to the X-ray source. The higher the density of the test specimen, the stronger the mask should be used. Generally, 0.5mm aluminum sheet can be used for paste specimen. Place the sample. Pay attention to aligning with the bottom aluminum plate to ensure that the sample is in the center of the CT stage, so as to ensure that the sample will not deviate from the radiation source during the rotation scanning process. Slowly close the door until the door detector closes. After the door detector is closed, the X-ray source can be turned on. 4. Program operation: Create a new file and name it with Date - sample sender - sample number. Open X-Ray-Tube and open Imagine-Capture. Move the distance between the CT sample stage and the detector. The distance between the stage and the radiation source determines the magnification, which depends on the size of the sample. Detector needs to capture all projections for calculation. Rotate the sample 360° to ensure that the sample is in the center of the CT stage. If the deviation is too large, the image capture and X-ray will need to be turned off and the placement process will need to be redone. According to the sample, set the general parameters [1]. Click Parameter get, and click Add to slicelist to obtain and generate the configuration file. Check the parameters of the image capture area, the RID should be 20-80%, generally 20-40%. Contrast min needs to be above 3000 [2]. Click Start and check whether the Center offset in the pop-up window is 0, if it is not 0, you need to close the program window and complete the program operation again. If the check is correct, you can start scanning.\n[1] Mentioned later.\n[2] It is difficult to adjust when the sample density is too light or too heavy, so the density distribution of the sample should be considered, otherwise the imaging quality will be affected. ⚠️: There are usually no problems with program operation. If there is a problem, the reasons are divided into hardware section and software section.\nAt the hardware section, filament loss is common. At this time, the filament needs to be replaced, and the equipment enters maintenance. Or the signal receiver and other components are damaged, and no software operation can be performed at this time. Leave the device open and contact a service engineer.\nIf there is a problem at the software section, close and open the YXLON-CT software, and then perform the program operation again.\nGeneral parameter settings:\nNumber of projections : \u0026gt;1080, generally choose 1530. Integration time (ms) : 250~300. Frame binning : 3. Voltage : 185, 190, 195 [1]. Output power(w) : 30 ~ 75.\n[1] Only these three values can be selected for the voltage value, because the instrument calibration process does not calibrate the full curve, only the voltage accuracy of these three places is calibrated. ⚠️: Generally speaking, the larger the number of projections, the longer the integration time, the larger the number of frames, and the higher the clarity, but the improvement effect is not obvious.\nThe voltage and power are related to the X-ray source. The larger the sample and the denser it is, the harder it is for X-rays to penetrate. We need to use higher voltage and higher power for scanning. Variations in sample size typically adjust voltage, and variations in density typically adjust power.\nThe X-ray source filament is a consumable product, the greater the power, the faster the consumption speed, and it is very sensitive to current, so generally use high voltage and low current. For example, paste samples generally use 190kV, 33w output power.\n5. Complete the follow-up: Wait for the program to automatically reconstruct the scan results. Using the data processing computer, slice the data results through VG software, and export the content in the form of picture slices. User guide - Chinese version 工业CT是用在工业领域的计算机断层成像技术的简称，它能在对检测物体无损伤条件下，以二维断层图像或三维立体图像的形式，清晰、准确、直观地展示被检测物体的内部结构、组成、材质及缺损状况，被誉为当今最佳无损检测和无损评估技术，是比探伤检测缺陷效果更精确，检测内容更全面的无损检测技术。\n设备型号：德国YXLON - Y.CT precision\n一、开机操作流程： 接通主电源 旋转控制电压钥匙：0 -\u0026gt; start -\u0026gt; 1。 旋转X射线钥匙：off -\u0026gt; on，等待5分钟， on -\u0026gt; system ready -\u0026gt; active。 打开工作站计算机，等待绿灯亮起，打开CT工作站主机，并输入密码。 打开舱门，确定所有遮挡片放置在X射线源处。 打开YXLON-CT软件，新建文件夹进入程序，等待X射线管内真空度达到100%，开始预热X射线灯丝。 将射线探测器移动至最偏远处。防止预热过程X射线对射线探测源造成过大损耗。 运行start up进行X射线灯丝的预热。若预热过程过慢，主要由于内部真空度不足，打开YXLON-Control软件，分别运行warm up和KV center进程。 等待Start up完成，便完成了开机启动过程，可以放置试样，调节参数，进行测试步骤。 ⚠️：非长假期间，CT主电源不关闭、工作站主机和X射线均需处于待机状态。一般工作日可直接从第5步进行。\n二、制样过程： 样品受到其最小约束圆柱体尺寸限制。一般最大直径10cm。 样品的最小体内圆截面应平行于X射线方向。最大体内圆截面应垂直于X射线方向。 样品最好可以稳定放置，若无法稳定，则需要使用橡皮泥将其固定在载物台上[1]。\n[1] 橡皮泥势必会影响样品底部成像，故需观察区应远离底部。 三、放置过程： 确定X射线源关闭。 选择合适遮挡片。遮挡片共六片，按照遮挡强度从弱至强为：0.5mm铝片、1mm铝片、0.5mm铁片、1mm铁片、0.5mm铅片、1mm铅片。放置时，应使得使得遮挡强度弱的遮挡片放置在靠近X射线源处。检测试样的密度越高，应当使用越强的遮挡片。净浆一般使用0.5mm铝片即可。 将带有样品的样品台。注意与底部铝板对齐，保证样品处于CT载物台中心，以保证旋转扫描过程，样品不会偏离射线源。 缓慢关闭舱门至舱门检测器闭合。舱门检测器闭合之后，X射线源才可以开启。 四、程序操作： 新建文件，以日期-送样人-样品编号进行命名。 开启X-Ray-Tube，开启Imagine-Capture。 移动CT样品载物台和探测器的距离。载物台与射线源的距离决定了放大倍数，而取决于样品的大小。而探测器需要将所有投射影响捕捉以进行计算。 将样品360° 旋转，以确保样品处于CT载物台中心。若偏离过大，则需要关闭图像捕捉和X射线，从放置过程重新开始。 根据样品情况，对常规参数[1]进行设置。 点击设置参数get，点击add to slicelist以获得并生成配置文件。 检查图像捕捉区参数，RID需在20～80%，一般以20～40%适中。Contrast min需在3000以上[2]。 点击开始，检查弹出窗口的Center offset是否为0，不为零则需要关闭程序窗口，重新完成程序操作。 若检查无误，则可以开始扫描。\n[1] 后文提及。\n[2] 在样品密度过轻、过重时难以调节，故样品需考虑密度分布，否则影响成像质量。 ⚠️：程序操作通常不会出现问题。若出现问题，原因分为硬件层面和软件层面。\n硬件层面常见为灯丝损耗，此时需要对灯丝进行更换，设备进入保养。或信号接收器等部件损坏，此时均无法进行任何软件操作。保持设备打开并联系维修工程师。\n软件层面出现问题，将YXLON-CT软件关闭再打开，再次进行程序操作即可。\n常规参数设置：\n投影张数: \u0026gt;1080，一般选择1530。 积分时间 – Integration(ms) : 250～300 。 帧数 – Frame binning : 3。 电压 – Voltage : 185，190，195 [1]。 功率 – Output(w) : 30 ~ 75。\n[1] 电压值仅选择这三个数值，仪器校对过程并未全曲线校对，仅校对这三处电压精确度。 ⚠️：一般来说，投影张数越大，积分时间越长，帧数越大，清晰程度越高，但提升效果并不明显。\n电压和功率与X射线源相关，样品越大、密度越大，那么X射线越难以穿透，我们需要使用更高的电压和更大的功率进行扫描。样品大小变化一般对电压进行调节，密度变化一般调节功率。\nX射线源灯丝是消耗品，功率越大，消耗速度越快，且对电流十分敏感，故一般使用大电压小电流。例如净浆试样一般使用190kV，33w输出功率。\n五、完成后续： 等待程序对扫描结果进行自动重建。 使用数据处理计算机，通过VG软件对数据结果进行切片处理，将内容以图片切片形式导出。 Pictures of Equipment Y.CT precision, X-ray tomography scanner, Southeast University Zeiss Xradia 510 Versa, 3D X-ray microscope, Southeast University Postscript It all started in 1895.\n1895\nWilhelm Conrad Röntgen found X-ray.\n1896\nCarl Heinrich Florenz Müller made the first X-ray tube in Hamburg.\n1967\nAllan Macleod Cormack solved the mathematical problems related to CT reconstruction.\n1972\nSir.

While I find reading relatively manageable, I encounter difficulties in the remaining three sections. Therefore, I need to dedicate more time to practicing and refining my skills in those areas. As the application season is approaching, I am feeling increasingly anxious about the status of my TOEFL preparation. Consequently, I must set specific tasks for myself to accomplish.\nThe speaking section of the TOEFL is particularly challenging for non-native speakers due to the lack of a language-rich environment. Thus, it is crucial to focus on practicing this section. I plan to take the TOEFL Speaking exam daily and dedicate at least one hour each day to practice.\nIn contrast, writing and listening are comparatively easier to practice. However, it is important not to confine our efforts solely to the exam itself. It is beneficial to engage in additional activities, such as watching educational videos and writing essays on various topics and tasks.\nLog - Aug 12 2023 After taking the test on July 22nd, I registered for another test scheduled for September 9th. From the previous test results, it\u0026rsquo;s apparent that my performance in the Listening and Speaking sections could use improvement compared to the other two sections. I\u0026rsquo;ve conducted research to find strategies for enhancing these skills, and I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that implementing these techniques will yield positive results.\nListening Section\nTip #1 - Create a TOEFL Listening study schedule\nTip #2 - Make your eyes your enemy\nTip #3 - Become a notetaking pro\nTip #4 - Memorize the question types\nTip #5 - Understand the passage structure like a professor\nTip #6 - Focus on vocabulary less, story more\nTip #7 - Be an active listener\nTip #8 - Think like a North American teacher\nTip #9 - Track your study progress\nTip #10 - Don\u0026rsquo;t panic\nSpeaking Section\nTip #1 - Practice instead of watching videos\nTip #2 - Record your voice\nTip #3 - Use a grading rubric to analyze your response\nTip #4 - Find a study buddy\nTip #5 - Move your hands when you speak\nTip #6 - Pick the right time and place when you study\nTip #7 - Start the same way for each question type every time\nTip #8 - Use a timer\nTip #9 - Take advantage of speech-to-text technology\nTip #10 - Get professional support from an experienced teacher\nThese tips are quite motivating, but their effectiveness depends on their proper implementation and execution.

Investing time yields corresponding rewards. However, life is fleeting, and our time is limited. There are things I could have done better with more time, yet I no longer have the time to do them. Although my best score of 101 didn\u0026rsquo;t meet my expectations, life is full of imperfections and not everything can be perfect. Thus, my TOEFL preparation ends here.\nNow, I begin a new journey to apply for Ph.D. programs.\n","date":"2023-06-08T01:24:44+08:00","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/languagelearn-toefl-learning-log/","title":"[LanguageLearn] TOEFL Learning Log"},{"content":"After a long time using Wordpress as my website structure, I felt that it is a little heavy to write a post. The structure gives you too many choices and that\u0026rsquo;s all graphical operation that always let me distracted. What\u0026rsquo;s more, you have to maintain a full server keeping both the front end and the back end working. Therefore, I chose to use Hugo to rebuild my website, which can make static websites easily and let me focus on the content rather than form.\nAnd this is the website built with Hugo, I have changed some configures in line with my usage habits. Main settings are as follows:\nStructure - Hugo + GitHub Page, it\u0026rsquo;s free, simple and needs little maintenance. Theme choice - Hugo theme stack, the theme is simple and intuitive. Custom domain - niugens.com, Github\u0026rsquo;s domain is hard to remember, so I use a simple one to redirect to GitHub page. Search engine indexability - Using Google analyze ID to let this website more indexable. Something else which is a little hard is not done right now, including:\nComment system. Muti-level categories. Life-plan calendar system. Links\u0026rsquo; initialization. Hope to take full advantage of this site to express and record my progress.\nThe building process refers to many others\u0026rsquo; instructions, including 失迹の博客, 雨临Lewis, Sulv\u0026rsquo;s Blog, Cassius\u0026rsquo;s Blog, Kyrie.\nThanks for them.\n","date":"2023-04-18T00:21:09+08:00","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/webbuild-use-hugo-to-build-a-website/","title":"[WebBuild] Use Hugo to build a website"},{"content":"GRE Score: 160 V + 170 Q + 3.5 AW I received my GRE score yesterday - 160 in Verbal and 170 in Quant, surpassing my own expectations.\nTaking the actual GRE test is crucial because it helps you realize that even when the test goes into the hard mode, the questions are not extremely difficult, and most can be solved using various analytical methods.\nPreparation Strategies Vocabulary The GRE doesn\u0026rsquo;t typically include very obscure or difficult words.\nThe words from the New Oriental Last-Minute Vocabulary List list cover about 85% of the vocabulary needed. Books like the NEW GRE vocabulary selection and KMF 3000 contain some specialized terms that rarely appear in the GRE.\nFor those aiming for a score around 325, a comprehensive mastery of those vocabulary isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary.\n\u0026ldquo;GRE Vocabulary\u0026rdquo; primarily features in the Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence sections, and to a lesser degree, in Reading Comprehension.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve initially memorized the word list, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to engage in active practice, because simply memorizing words is not enough to substantially enhance your understanding of their meanings.\nIt is through extensive practice that you\u0026rsquo;ll deepen your grasp of the nuances and applications of key vocabulary words.\nVerbal The Sentence Equivalence question is crucial for scoring, as you need to choose two synonymous or nearly synonymous words.\nThese questions are generally short and can be quickly solved by interpreting the tone, taking about 30 seconds each. Correctly answering these questions not only ensures entry into the Medium or Hard difficulty but also saves considerable time for other questions, thereby improving overall accuracy.\nFor other Text Completion, focus on attitude determination and understanding of logical connectors. With the vocabulary preparation mentioned earlier, identifying the tone of words becomes more manageable.\nReading Comprehension in GRE, including short and long passages, can be well tackled by understanding the logic behind question types like main idea, function, detail, sentence selection, and logic questions. A good comprehension level maintains an accuracy rate of about 50% to 80%.\nQuant While there are some tough questions in Quant, the overall level is about middle school grade, so it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary to spend too much time on it.\nReviewing a math outline and revisiting necessary concepts like Vieta\u0026rsquo;s theorem is beneficial. Remembering English terms for mathematical concepts, such as \u0026ldquo;mode\u0026rdquo; for the most common value, is also important.\nAfterword After achieving this GRE score, I feel a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I can move forward. To conclude, I quote a line from the GRE Writing Black Book:\nMany things lose their charm once conquered, but GRE is an exception.\n","date":"2023-04-03T00:21:09+08:00","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/grelearn-gre-330-my-journey/","title":"[GRELearn] GRE 330: My Journey"}]
