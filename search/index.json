It can clearly, accurately and intuitively display the interior of the detected object in the form of two-dimensional tomographic images or three-dimensional images without damaging the detected object. The structure, composition, material and defect status are known as the best non-destructive testing and non-destructive evaluation technology today.

As an international student aspiring to pursue a Ph.D. program, achieving a competitive TOEFL score is a prerequisite. With this in mind, I have created this blog as a personal log to document my TOEFL learning journey and provide assistance throughout the process.\nLearning material: TOEFL KMF, which includes all TPOs and lots of tools to promote my TOEFL.\nLearning time: 2 Hours at least.\nAnd I have had some pre-exam on the testing website, and some scores are given, as Table 1 shown.\nTimeline Reading Listening Speaking Writing Before July 14 25 ~ 30 19 ~ 27 19 ~ 23 18 ~ 24 Test on July 22 28 23 19 24 Target Scores 30 30 25 25 I have been studying for the TOEFL for nearly a month and have realized that several areas require improvement. While I find reading relatively manageable, I encounter difficulties in the remaining three sections. Therefore, I need to dedicate more time to practicing and refining my skills in those areas. As the application season is approaching, I am feeling increasingly anxious about the status of my TOEFL preparation. Consequently, I must set specific tasks for myself to accomplish.\nThe speaking section of the TOEFL is particularly challenging for non-native speakers due to the lack of a language-rich environment. Thus, it is crucial to focus on practicing this section. I plan to take the TOEFL Speaking exam daily and dedicate at least one hour each day to practice.\nIn contrast, writing and listening are comparatively easier to practice. However, it is important not to confine our efforts solely to the exam itself. It is beneficial to engage in additional activities, such as watching educational videos and writing essays on various topics and tasks.\nEdited: June 08 2023\nAfter taking the test on July 22nd, I registered for another test scheduled for September 9th. From the previous test results, it\u0026rsquo;s apparent that my performance in the Listening and Speaking sections could use improvement compared to the other two sections. I\u0026rsquo;ve conducted research to find strategies for enhancing these skills, and I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that implementing these techniques will yield positive results.\nListening Section\nTip #1 - Create a TOEFL Listening study schedule Tip #2 - Make your eyes your enemy Tip #3 - Become a notetaking pro Tip #4 - Memorize the question types Tip #5 - Understand the passage structure like a professor Tip #6 - Focus on vocabulary less, story more Tip #7 - Be an active listener Tip #8 - Think like a North American teacher Tip #9 - Track your study progress Tip #10 - Don\u0026rsquo;t panic\nSpeaking Section\nTip #1 - Practice instead of watching videos Tip #2 - Record your voice Tip #3 - Use a grading rubric to analyze your response Tip #4 - Find a study buddy Tip #5 - Move your hands when you speak Tip #6 - Pick the right time and place when you study Tip #7 - Start the same way for each question type every time Tip #8 - Use a timer Tip #9 - Take advantage of speech-to-text technology Tip #10 - Get professional support from an experienced teacher\nThese tips are quite motivating, but their effectiveness depends on their proper implementation and execution. With ample time remaining until the next test, I am hopeful that by following these guidelines, I can achieve the target score I am aiming for.\nEdited: Aug 12 2023\n","date":"2023-06-08T01:24:44+08:00","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/languagelearn-toefl-learning-log/","title":"[LanguageLearn] TOEFL Learning Log"},{"content":"After a long time using Wordpress as my website structure, I felt that it is a little heavy to write a post. The structure gives you too many choices and that\u0026rsquo;s all graphical operation that always let me distracted. What\u0026rsquo;s more, you have to maintain a full server keeping both the front end and the back end working. Therefore, I chose to use Hugo to rebuild my website, which can make static websites easily and let me focus on the content rather than form.\nAnd this is the website built with Hugo, I have changed some configures in line with my usage habits. Main settings are as follows:\nStructure - Hugo + GitHub Page, it\u0026rsquo;s free, simple and needs little maintenance. Theme choice - Hugo theme stack, the theme is simple and intuitive. Custom domain - niugens.com, Github\u0026rsquo;s domain is hard to remember, so I use a simple one to redirect to GitHub page. Search engine indexability - Using Google analyze ID to let this website more indexable. Something else which is a little hard is not done right now, including:\nComment system. Muti-level categories. Life-plan calendar system. Links\u0026rsquo; initialization. Hope to take full advantage of this site to express and record my progress.\nThe building process refers to many others\u0026rsquo; instructions, including 失迹の博客, 雨临Lewis, Sulv\u0026rsquo;s Blog, Cassius\u0026rsquo;s Blog, Kyrie.\nThanks for them.\n","date":"2023-04-18T00:21:09+08:00","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/webbuild-use-hugo-to-build-a-website/","title":"[WebBuild] Use Hugo to build a website"}]
