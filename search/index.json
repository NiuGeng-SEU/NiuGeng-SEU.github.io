[{"content":"TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is a globally acknowledged English proficiency test, similar to IELTS but with its own distinct characteristics. As an international student aspiring to pursue a Ph.D. program, achieving a competitive TOEFL score is a prerequisite. With this in mind, I have created this blog as a personal log to document my TOEFL learning journey and provide assistance throughout the process.\nLearning material: TOEFL KMF, which includes all TPOs and lots of tools to promote my TOEFL.\nLearning time: 2 Hours at least.\nBuild a figure reflecting the learning time of four parts by Matlab. Publish the code and insect the figure on this page. Take a pre-exam period and give a figure to predict the scores getting in the test.

The structure gives you too many choices and that\u0026rsquo;s all graphical operation that always let me distracted. What\u0026rsquo;s more, you have to maintain a full server keeping both the front end and the back end working. Therefore, I chose to use Hugo to rebuild my website, which can make static websites easily and let me focus on the content rather than form.\nAnd this is the website built with Hugo, I have changed some configures in line with my usage habits. Main settings are as follows:\nStructure - Hugo + GitHub Page, it\u0026rsquo;s free, simple and needs little maintenance. Theme choice - Hugo theme stack, the theme is simple and intuitive. Custom domain - niugens.com, Github\u0026rsquo;s domain is hard to remember, so I use a simple one to redirect to GitHub page. Search engine indexability - Using Google analyze ID to let this website more indexable. Something else which is a little hard is not done right now, including:\nComment system. Muti-level categories. Life-plan calendar system. Links\u0026rsquo; initialization. Hope to take full advantage of this site to express and record my progress.\nThe building process refers to many others\u0026rsquo; instructions, including 失迹の博客, 雨临Lewis, Sulv\u0026rsquo;s Blog, Cassius\u0026rsquo;s Blog, Kyrie.\nThanks for them.\n","date":"2023-04-18T00:21:09+08:00","permalink":"https://niugens.com/p/webbuild-use-hugo-to-build-a-website/","title":"[WebBuild] Use Hugo to build a website"}]
